# Data Structures

> Storage format that enable us to access and modify it efficiently.
> It's an abstract collection of data values, and relationship among them.


### Node 

>  A basic unit, which often is implemented by pointers.

[ **next** ][ **value** ][ **tail** ]

### Linked List

> Linear data structure where every element is a separated object [node](). 
> Each element is linked using pointers. 
> Each node of a list is made up of two items - the **value** and a **reference** to the next node.

### Doubly Linked List 

> It is a type of linked list in which **each node** apart from storing its data **has two references**.

### Stack

> It is basic data structure that can be logically thought of as a linear structure represented by a real physical stack or pile.
> It is a structure where insertion and deletion of items takes place at one end called top of the stack.

### Circular Queue

> It is a linear data structure in which the operations are performed based on **FIFO** (First In First Out) principle 
> and the last position is connected back to the first position to make a circle.

### Tree

> It simulates a hierarchical tree structure, with a **root** value and subtrees of **children** with a **parent node**,
> represented as a set of linked nodes.

- Depth first Search tree **(DFS)**

- Breadth First Search **(BFS)**

### Binary Tree

> It is a Tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, 
> which are referred to as the left child and the right child.


- Preorder **(Root, Left, Right)**

- Inorder **(Left, Root, Right)**

- Postorder **(Left, Right, Root)**
