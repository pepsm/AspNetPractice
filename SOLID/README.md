## SOLID Design principles

It is a mnemonic acronym for **five design principles** intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible and maintainable.


1. **Single Responsibility Principle**

> A class should have one, and only one, reason to change.

2. **Open Closed Principle** 

> You should be able to extend a classâ€™s behavior, without modifying it.

3. **Liskov Subtitution Principle**

> If any module is using a **Base class** then the reference to that Base class can be **replaced with a Derived class** without affecting the functionality of the module.

4. **Interface Segregation Principle**

> No class should be forced to depend on methods it does not use.

5. **Dependency Inversion Principle**

> Depends on abstractions not on concrete implementations.
